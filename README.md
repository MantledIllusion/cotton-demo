# cotton-demo
Demo project for Cotton functionality; see the [Wiki](https://github.com/MantledIllusion/cotton-demo/wiki) for tutorials and branches for code examples.

**NOTE:** Cotton (V1.x) uses Vaadin 8, which is deprecated. If having the choice, use [Cotton-Flow](https://github.com/MantledIllusion/cotton-flow) instead!
